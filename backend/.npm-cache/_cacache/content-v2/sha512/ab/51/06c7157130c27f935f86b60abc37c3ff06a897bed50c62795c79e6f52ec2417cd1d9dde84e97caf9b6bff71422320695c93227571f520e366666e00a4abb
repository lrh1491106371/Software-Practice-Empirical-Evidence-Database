It assists in multiple ways, including scaffolding the project, serving it in development mode, and building and bundling the application for production distribution. It embodies best-practice architectural patterns to encourage well-structured apps.\n\nThe CLI works with [schematics](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/tree/master/packages/angular_devkit/schematics), and provides built in support from the schematics collection at [@nestjs/schematics](https://github.com/nestjs/schematics).\n\nRead more [here](https://docs.nestjs.com/cli/overview).\n\n## Installation\n\n```\n$ npm install -g @nestjs/cli\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nLearn more in the [official documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/cli/overview).\n\n## Stay in touch\n\n- Website - [https://nestjs.com](https://nestjs.com/)\n- Twitter -

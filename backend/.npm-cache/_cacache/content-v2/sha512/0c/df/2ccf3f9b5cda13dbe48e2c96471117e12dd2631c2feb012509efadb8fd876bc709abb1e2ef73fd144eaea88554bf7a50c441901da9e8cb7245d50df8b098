This transport\ndepends on a common module called the _NATS Base Client_ which lives along the\n[nats.deno](https://github.com/nats-io/nats.deno/tree/main/nats-base-client).\nThe NATS Base Client provides the same API and functionality across all\nJavaScript NATS clients supported by nats.io (nats.deno, nats.js and nats.ws).\n\nWhile the best documentation is looking at code examples, you may want to browse\nthe [JSDoc documentation](https://nats-io.github.io/nats.deno). The best entry\npoint into the JS Doc is the\n[NatsConnection](https://nats-io.github.io/nats.deno/interfaces/NatsConnection.html)\nall functionality starts with a connection.\n\n## Basics\n\n### Connecting to a nats-server\n\nTo connect to a server you use the `connect()` function. It returns a connection\nthat you can use to interact with the server. You can customize the behavior of\nthe client by specifying many [`ConnectionOptions`](#connection-options).\n\nBy default, a connection will attempt a connection on`127.0.0.1:4222`. If the\nconnection is dropped, the client will attempt to reconnect. You can customize\nthe server you want to connect to by specifying `port` (for local connections),\nor full host port on the `servers` option. Note that the `servers` option can be\na single hostport (a string) or an array of hostports.\n\nThe example below will attempt to connect to different servers by specifying\ndifferent `ConnectionOptions`. At least two of them should work if your internet\nis working.\n\n```javascript\nimport { connect } from \"nats\";\nconst servers = [\n  {},\n  { servers: [\"demo.nats.io:4442\", \"demo.nats.io:4222\"] },\n  { servers: \"demo.nats.io:4443\" },\n  { port: 4222 },\n  { servers: \"localhost\" },\n];\nawait servers.forEach(async (v) => {\n  try {\n    const nc = await connect(v);\n    console.log(`connected to ${nc.getServer()}`);\n    // this promise indicates the client closed\n    const done = nc.closed();\n    // do something with the connection\n\n    // close the connection\n    await nc.close();\n    // check if the close was OK\n    const err = await done;\n    if (err) {\n      console.log(`error closing:`, err);\n    }\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.log(`error connecting to ${JSON.stringify(v)}`);\n  }\n});\n```\n\nTo disconnect from the nats-server, call `close()` on the connection. A\nconnection can also be terminated when an unexpected error happens. For example,\nthe server returns a run-time error. In those cases, the client will re-initiate\na connection.\n\nBy default, the client will always attempt to reconnect if the connection is\nclosed for a reason other than calling `close()`. To get notified when the\nconnection is closed for some reason, await the resolution of the Promise\nreturned by `closed()`. If closed resolves to a value, the value is a\n`NatsError` indicating why the connection closed.\n\n### Publish and Subscribe\n\nThe basic client operations are `publish` to send messages and `subscribe` to\nreceive messages.\n\nMessages are published to a subject. A subject is like a URL with the exception\nthat it doesn't specify an actual endpoint. All recipients that have expressed\ninterest in a subject will receive messages addressed to that subject (provided\nthey have access and permissions to get it). To express interest in a subject,\nyou create a `subscription`.\n\nIn JavaScript clients (websocket, Deno, or Node) subscriptions work as an async\niterator - clients simply loop to process messages as they become available.\n\nNATS messages are payload agnostic. Payloads are `Uint8Arrays`. You can easily\nconvert to and from JSON or strings by using `JSONCodec` or `StringCodec`, or a\ncustom `Codec`.\n\nTo cancel a subscription and terminate your interest, you call `unsubscribe()`\nor `drain()` on a subscription. Unsubscribe will typically terminate regardless\nof whether there are messages in flight for the client. Drain ensures that all\nmessages that are inflight are processed before canceling the subscription.\nConnections can also be drained as well. Draining a connection closes it, after\nall subscriptions have been drained and all outbound messages have been sent to\nthe server.\n\n```javascript\nimport { connect, StringCodec } from \"nats\";\n\n// to create a connection to a nats-server:\nconst nc = await connect({ servers: \"demo.nats.io:4222\" });\n\n// create a codec\nconst sc = StringCodec();\n// create a simple subscriber and iterate over messages\n// matching the subscription\nconst sub = nc.subscribe(\"hello\");\n(async () => {\n  for await (const m of sub) {\n    console.log(`[${sub.getProcessed()}]: ${sc.decode(m.data)}`);\n  }\n  console.log(\"subscription closed\");\n})();\n\nnc.publish(\"hello\", sc.encode(\"world\"));\nnc.publish(\"hello\", sc.encode(\"again\"));\n\n// we want to ensure that messages that are in flight\n// get processed, so we are going to drain the\n// connection. Drain is the same as close, but makes\n// sure that all messages in flight get seen\n// by the iterator. After calling drain on the connection\n// the connection closes.\nawait nc.drain();\n```\n\n### Wildcard Subscriptions\n\nSubjects can be used to organize messages into hierarchies. For example, a\nsubject may contain additional information that can be useful in providing a\ncontext to the message, such as the ID of the client that sent the message, or\nthe region where a message originated.\n\nInstead of subscribing to each specific subject, you can create subscriptions\nthat have subjects with wildcards. Wildcards match one or more tokens in a\nsubject. A token is a string following a period.\n\nAll subscriptions are independent. If two different subscriptions match a\nsubject, both will get to process the message:\n\n```javascript\nimport { connect, StringCodec } from \"nats\";\n\nconst nc = await connect({ servers: \"demo.nats.io:4222\" });\nconst sc = StringCodec();\n\n// subscriptions can have wildcard subjects\n// the '*' matches any string in the specified token position\nconst s1 = nc.subscribe(\"help.*.system\");\nconst s2 = nc.subscribe(\"help.me.*\");\n// the '>' matches any tokens in that position or following\n// '>' can only be specified at the end of the subject\nconst s3 = nc.subscribe(\"help.>\");\n\nasync function printMsgs(s) {\n  let subj = s.getSubject();\n  console.log(`listening for ${subj}`);\n  const c = 13 - subj.length;\n  const pad = \"\".padEnd(c);\n  for await (const m of s) {\n    console.log(\n      `[${subj}]${pad} #${s.getProcessed()} - ${m.subject} ${\n        m.data ? \" \" + sc.decode(m.data) : \"\"\n      }`,\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nprintMsgs(s1);\nprintMsgs(s2);\nprintMsgs(s3);\n\n// don't exit until the client closes\nawait nc.closed();\n```\n\n### Services: Request/Reply\n\nRequest/Reply is NATS equivalent to an HTTP request. To make requests you\npublish messages as you did before, but also specify a `reply` subject. The\n`reply` subject is where a service will publish your response.\n\nNATS provides syntactic sugar, for publishing requests. The `request()` API will\ngenerate a reply subject and manage the creation of a subscription under the\ncovers. It will also start a timer to ensure that if a response is not received\nwithin your allotted time, the request fails. The example also illustrates a\ngraceful shutdown.\n\n#### Services\n\nHere's an example of a service. It is a bit more complicated than expected\nsimply to illustrate not only how to create responses, but how the subject\nitself is used to dispatch different behaviors.\n\n```javascript\nimport { connect, StringCodec } from \"nats\";\n\n// create a connection\nconst nc = await connect({ servers: \"demo.nats.io\" });\n\n// create a codec\nconst sc = StringCodec();\n\n// this subscription listens for `time` requests and returns the current time\nconst subscription = nc.subscribe(\"time\");\n(async (sub) => {\n  console.log(`listening for ${sub.getSubject()} requests...`);\n  for await (const m of sub) {\n    if (m.respond(sc.encode(new Date().toISOString()))) {\n      console.info(`[time] handled #${sub.getProcessed()}`);\n    } else {\n      console.log(`[time] #${sub.getProcessed()} ignored - no reply subject`);\n    }\n  }\n  console.log(`subscription ${sub.getSubject()} drained.`);\n})(subscription);\n\n// this subscription listens for admin.uptime and admin.stop\n// requests to admin.uptime returns how long the service has been running\n// requests to admin.stop gracefully stop the client by draining\n// the connection\nconst started = Date.now();\nconst msub = nc.subscribe(\"admin.*\");\n(async (sub) => {\n  console.log(`listening for ${sub.getSubject()} requests [uptime | stop]`);\n  // it would be very good to verify the origin of the request\n  // before implementing something that allows your service to be managed.\n  // NATS can limit which client can send or receive on what subjects.\n  for await (const m of sub) {\n    const chunks = m.subject.split(\".\");\n    console.info(`[admin] #${sub.getProcessed()} handling ${chunks[1]}`);\n    switch (chunks[1]) {\n      case \"uptime\":\n        // send the number of millis since up\n        m.respond(sc.encode(`${Date.now() - started}`));\n        break;\n      case \"stop\": {\n        m.respond(sc.encode(`[admin] #${sub.getProcessed()} stopping....`));\n        // gracefully shutdown\n        nc.drain()\n          .catch((err) => {\n            console.log(\"error draining\", err);\n          });\n        break;\n      }\n      default:\n        console.log(\n          `[admin] #${sub.getProcessed()} ignoring request for ${m.subject}`,\n        );\n    }\n  }\n  console.log(`subscription ${sub.getSubject()} drained.`);\n})(msub);\n\n// wait for the client to close here.\nawait nc.closed().then((err) => {\n  let m = `connection to ${nc.getServer()} closed`;\n  if (err) {\n    m = `${m} with an error: ${err.message}`;\n  }\n  console.log(m);\n});\n```\n\n#### Making Requests\n\nHere's a simple example of a client making a simple request from the service\nabove:\n\n```javascript\nimport { connect, Empty, StringCodec } from \"nats\";\n\n// create a connection\nconst nc = await connect({ servers: \"demo.nats.io:4222\" });\n\n// create an encoder\nconst sc = StringCodec();\n\n// the client makes a request and receives a promise for a message\n// by default the request times out after 1s (1000 millis) and has\n// no payload.\nawait nc.request(\"time\", Empty, { timeout: 1000 })\n  .then((m) => {\n    console.log(`got response: ${sc.decode(m.data)}`);\n  })\n  .catch((err) => {\n    console.log(`problem with request: ${err.message}`);\n  });\n\nawait nc.close();\n```\n\n### Queue Groups\n\nQueue groups allow scaling of services horizontally. Subscriptions for members\nof a queue group are treated as a single service. When you send a message to a\nqueue group subscription, only a single client in a queue group will receive it.\n\nThere can be any number of queue groups. Each group is treated as its own\nindependent unit. Note that non-queue subscriptions are also independent of\nsubscriptions in a queue group.\n\n```javascript\nimport {\n  connect,\n  NatsConnection,\n  StringCodec,\n} from \"nats\";\n\nasync function createService(\n  name,\n  count = 1,\n  queue = \"\"\n): Promise {\n  const conns = [];\n  for (let i = 1; i <= count; i++) {\n    const n = queue ? `${name}-${i}` : name;\n    const nc = await connect(\n      { servers: \"demo.nats.io:4222\", name: `${n}` },\n    );\n    nc.closed()\n      .then((err) => {\n        if (err) {\n          console.error(\n            `service ${n} exited because of error: ${err.message}`,\n          );\n        }\n      });\n    // create a subscription - note the option for a queue, if set\n    // any client with the same queue will be a member of the group.\n    const sub = nc.subscribe(\"echo\", { queue: queue });\n    const _ = handleRequest(n, sub);\n    console.log(`${nc.options.name} is listening for 'echo' requests...`);\n    conns.push(nc);\n  }\n  return conns;\n}\n\nconst sc = StringCodec();\n\n// simple handler for service requests\nasync function handleRequest(name, s) {\n  const p = 12 - name.length;\n  const pad = \"\".padEnd(p);\n  for await (const m of s) {\n    // respond returns true if the message had a reply subject, thus it could respond\n    if (m.respond(m.data)) {\n      console.log(\n        `[${name}]:${pad} #${s.getProcessed()} echoed ${sc.decode(m.data)}`,\n      );\n    } else {\n      console.log(\n        `[${name}]:${pad} #${s.getProcessed()} ignoring request - no reply subject`,\n      );\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// let's create two queue groups and a standalone subscriber\nconst conns = [];\nconns.push(...await createService(\"echo\", 3, \"echo\"));\nconns.push(...await createService(\"other-echo\", 2, \"other-echo\"));\nconns.push(...await createService(\"standalone\"));\n\nconst a: Promise<void | Error>[] = [];\nconns.forEach((c) => {\n  a.push(c.closed());\n});\nawait Promise.all(a);\n```\n\nRun it and publish a request to the subject `echo` to see what happens.\n\n## Advanced Usage\n\n### Headers\n\nNATS headers are similar to HTTP headers. Headers are enabled automatically if\nthe server supports them. Note that if you publish a message using headers, and\nthe server doesn't support them, an Error is thrown. Also note that even if you\nare publishing a message with a header, it is possible for the recipient to not\nsupport them.\n\n```javascript\nimport { connect, createInbox, Empty, headers } from \"nats\";\n\nconst nc = await connect(\n  {\n    servers: `demo.nats.io`,\n  },\n);\n\nconst subj = createInbox();\nconst sub = nc.subscribe(subj);\n(async () => {\n  for await (const m of sub) {\n    if (m.headers) {\n      for (const [key, value] of m.headers) {\n        console.log(`${key}=${value}`);\n      }\n      // reading/setting a header is not case sensitive\n      console.log(\"id\", m.headers.get(\"id\"));\n    }\n  }\n})().then();\n\n// headers always have their names turned into a canonical mime header key\n// header names can be any printable ASCII character with the  exception of `:`.\n// header values can be any ASCII character except `\\r` or `\\n`.\n// see https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc822.txt\nconst h = headers();\nh.append(\"id\", \"123456\");\nh.append(\"unix_time\", Date.now().toString());\nnc.publish(subj, Empty, { headers: h });\n\nawait nc.flush();\nawait nc.close();\n```\n\n### No Responders\n\nRequests can fail for many reasons. A common reason for a failure is the lack of\ninterest in the subject. Typically, these surface as a timeout error. If the\nserver is enabled to use headers, it will also enable a `no responders` feature.\nIf you send a request for which there's no interest, the request will be\nimmediately rejected:\n\n```javascript\nconst nc = await connect({\n  servers: `demo.nats.io`,\n});\n\ntry {\n  const m = await nc.request(\"hello.world\");\n  console.log(m.data);\n} catch (err) {\n  switch (err.code) {\n    case ErrorCode.NoResponders:\n      console.log(\"no one is listening to 'hello.world'\");\n      break;\n    case ErrorCode.Timeout:\n      console.log(\"someone is listening but didn't respond\");\n      break;\n    default:\n      console.log(\"request failed\", err);\n  }\n}\n\nawait nc.close();\n```\n\n### Authentication\n\nNATS supports many different forms of authentication:\n\n- username/password\n- token\n- NKEYS\n- client certificates\n- JWTs\n\nFor user/password and token authentication, you can simply provide them as\n`ConnectionOptions` - see `user`, `pass`, `token`. Internally these mechanisms\nare implemented as an `Authenticator`. An `Authenticator` is simply a function\nthat handles the type of authentication specified.\n\nSetting the `user`/`pass` or `token` options, simply initializes an\n`Authenticator` and sets the username/password.\n\n```javascript\n// if the connection requires authentication, provide `user` and `pass` or\n// `token` options in the NatsConnectionOptions\nimport { connect } from \"nats\";\n\nconst nc1 = await connect({\n  servers: \"127.0.0.1:4222\",\n  user: \"jenny\",\n  pass: \"867-5309\",\n});\nconst nc2 = await connect({ port: 4222, token: \"t0pS3cret!\" });\n```\n\n#### Authenticators\n\nNKEYs and JWT authentication are more complex, as they cryptographically respond\nto a server challenge.\n\nBecause NKEY and JWT authentication may require reading data from a file or an\nHTTP cookie, these forms of authentication will require a bit more from the\ndeveloper to activate them. However, the work is related to accessing these\nresources varies depending on the platform.\n\nAfter the credential artifacts are read, you can use one of these functions to\ncreate the authenticator. You then simply assign it to the `authenticator`\nproperty of the `ConnectionOptions`:\n\n- `nkeyAuthenticator(seed?: Uint8Array | (() => Uint8Array)): Authenticator`\n- `jwtAuthenticator(jwt: string | (() => string), seed?: Uint8Array | (()=> Uint8Array)): Authenticator`\n- `credsAuthenticator(creds: Uint8Array): Authenticator`\n\nThe first two options provide the ability to specify functions that return the\ndesired value. This enables dynamic environments such as a browser where values\naccessed by fetching a value from a cookie.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```javascript\n// read the creds file as necessary, in the case it\n// is part of the code for illustration purposes\nconst creds = `-----BEGIN NATS USER JWT-----\n    eyJ0eXAiOiJqdSDJB....\n  ------END NATS USER JWT------\n\n************************* IMPORTANT *************************\n  NKEY Seed printed below can be used sign and prove identity.\n  NKEYs are sensitive and should be treated as secrets.\n\n  -----BEGIN USER NKEY SEED-----\n    SUAIBDPBAUTW....\n  ------END USER NKEY SEED------\n`;\n\nconst nc = await connect(\n  {\n    port: 4222,\n    authenticator: credsAuthenticator(new TextEncoder().encode(creds)),\n  },\n);\n```\n\nThe node client supports the ability to verify the tls connection if client\ncertificates are specified as ConnectionOptions:\n\n```javascript\ntlsOptions = {\n  keyFile: \"./test/certs/client-key.pem\",\n  certFile: \"./test/certs/client-cert.pem\",\n  caFile: \"./test/certs/ca.pem\",\n};\nnc = await connect({ tls: tlsOptions });\n```\n\n### Flush\n\nFlush sends a PING to the server. When the server responds with PONG you are\nguaranteed that all pending data was sent and received by the server. Note\n`ping()` effectively adds a server round-trip. All NATS clients handle their\nbuffering optimally, so `ping(): Promise<void>` shouldn't be used except in\ncases where you are writing some sort of test.\n\n```javascript\nnc.publish(\"foo\");\nnc.publish(\"bar\");\nawait nc.flush();\n```\n\n### `PublishOptions`\n\nWhen you publish a message you can specify some options:\n\n- `reply` - this is a subject to receive a reply (you must set up a\n  subscription) before you publish.\n- `headers` - a set of headers to decorate the message.\n\n### `SubscriptionOptions`\n\nYou can specify several options when creating a subscription:\n\n- `max`: maximum number of messages to receive - auto unsubscribe\n- `timeout`: how long to wait for the first message\n- `queue`: the [queue group](#queue-groups) name the subscriber belongs to\n- `callback`: a function with the signature\n  `(err: NatsError|null, msg: Msg) => void;` that should be used for handling\n  the message. Subscriptions with callbacks are NOT iterators.\n\n#### Auto Unsubscribe\n\n```javascript\n// subscriptions can auto unsubscribe after a certain number of messages\nnc.subscribe(\"foo\", { max: 10 });\n```\n\n#### Timeout Subscriptions\n\n```javascript\n// create subscription with a timeout, if no message arrives\n// within the timeout, the function running the iterator with\n// reject - depending on how you code it, you may need a\n// try/catch block.\nconst sub = nc.subscribe(\"hello\", { timeout: 1000 });\n(async () => {\n  for await (const m of sub) {\n  }\n})().catch((err) => {\n  if (err.code === ErrorCode.Timeout) {\n    console.log(`sub timed out!`);\n  } else {\n    console.log(`sub iterator got an error!`);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### `RequestOptions`\n\nWhen making a request, there are several options you can pass:\n\n- `timeout`: how long to wait for the response\n- `headers`: optional headers to include with the message\n- `noMux`: create a new subscription to handle the request. Normally a shared\n  subscription is used to receive response messages.\n- `reply`: optional subject where the reply should be sent.\n\n#### `noMux` and `reply`\n\nUnder the hood, the request API simply uses a wildcard subscription to handle\nall requests you send.\n\nIn some cases, the default subscription strategy doesn't work correctly. For\nexample, a client may be constrained by the subjects where it can receive\nreplies.\n\nWhen `noMux` is set to `true`, the client will create a normal subscription for\nreceiving the response to a generated inbox subject before the request is\npublished. The `reply` option can be used to override the generated inbox\nsubject with an application provided one. Note that setting `reply` requires\n`noMux` to be `true`:\n\n```javascript\nconst m = await nc.request(\n  \"q\",\n  Empty,\n  { reply: \"bar\", noMux: true, timeout: 1000 },\n);\n```\n\n### Draining Connections and Subscriptions\n\nDraining provides for a graceful way to unsubscribe or close a connection\nwithout losing messages that have already been dispatched to the client.\n\nYou can drain a subscription or all subscriptions in a connection.\n\nWhen you drain a subscription, the client sends an `unsubscribe` protocol\nmessage to the server followed by a `flush`. The subscription handler is only\nremoved after the server responds. Thus, all pending messages for the\nsubscription have been processed.\n\nDraining a connection, drains all subscriptions. However, when you drain the\nconnection it becomes impossible to make new subscriptions or send new requests.\nAfter the last subscription is drained, it also becomes impossible to publish a\nmessage. These restrictions do not exist when just draining a subscription.\n\n### Lifecycle/Informational Events\n\nClients can get notification on various event types:\n\n- `Events.Disconnect`\n- `Events.Reconnect`\n- `Events.Update`\n- `Events.LDM`\n- `Events.Error`\n\nThe first two fire when a client disconnects and reconnects respectively. The\npayload will be the server where the event took place.\n\nThe `UPDATE` event notifies whenever the client receives a cluster configuration\nupdate. The `ServersChanged` interface provides two arrays: `added` and\n`deleted` listing the servers that were added or removed.\n\nThe `LDM` event notifies that the current server has signaled that it is running\nin _Lame Duck Mode_ and will evict clients. Depending on the server\nconfiguration policy, the client may want to initiate an ordered shutdown, and\ninitiate a new connection to a different server in the cluster.\n\nThe `ERROR` event notifies you of async errors that couldn't be routed in a more\nprecise way to your client. For example, permission errors for a subscription or\nrequest, will properly be reported by the subscription or request. However,\npermission errors on publish will be reported via the status mechanism.\n\n```javascript\nconst nc = await connect();\n(async () => {\n  console.info(`connected ${nc.getServer()}`);\n  for await (const s of nc.status()) {\n    console.info(`${s.type}: ${s.data}`);\n  }\n})().then();\n\nnc.closed()\n  .then((err) => {\n    console.log(\n      `connection closed ${err ? \" with error: \" + err.message : \"\"}`,\n    );\n  });\n```\n\nBe aware that when a client closes, you will need to wait for the `closed()`\npromise to resolve. When it resolves, the client is done and will not reconnect.\n\n### Async vs. Callbacks\n\nPrevious versions of the JavaScript NATS clients specified callbacks for message\nprocessing. This required complex handling logic when a service required\ncoordination of operations. Callbacks are an inversion of control anti-pattern.\n\nThe async APIs trivialize complex coordination and makes your code easier to\nmaintain. With that said, there are some implications:\n\n- Async subscriptions buffer inbound messages.\n- Subscription processing delays until the runtime executes the promise related\n  microtasks at the end of an event loop.\n\nIn a traditional callback-based library, I/O happens after all data yielded by a\nread in the current event loop completes processing. This means that callbacks\nare invoked as part of processing. With async, the processing is queued in a\nmicrotask queue. At the end of the event loop, the runtime processes the\nmicrotasks, which in turn resumes your functions. As expected, this increases\nlatency, but also provides additional liveliness.\n\nTo reduce async latency, the NATS client allows processing a subscription in the\nsame event loop that dispatched the message. Simply specify a `callback` in the\nsubscription options. The signature for a callback is\n`(err: (NatsError|null), msg: Msg) => void`. When specified, the subscription\niterator will never yield a message, as the callback will intercept all\nmessages.\n\nNote that `callback` likely shouldn't even be documented, as likely it is a\nworkaround to an underlying application problem where you should be considering\na different strategy to horizontally scale your application, or reduce pressure\non the clients, such as using queue workers, or more explicitly targeting\nmessages. With that said, there are many situations where using callbacks can be\nmore performant or appropriate.\n\n## Connection Options\n\nThe following is the list of connection options and default values.\n\n| Option                  | Default            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| ----------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `authenticator`         | none               | Specifies the authenticator function that sets the client credentials.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| `debug`                 | `false`            | If `true`, the client prints protocol interactions to the console.

They control how long before the NATS\nclient attempts to reconnect to a server it has previously connected.\n\nThe intention of the settings is to spread out the number of clients attempting\nto reconnect to a server over a period of time, and thus preventing a\n[\"Thundering Herd\"](https://docs.nats.io/developing-with-nats/reconnect/random).\n\nThe relationship between these are:\n\n- If `reconnectDelayHandler` is specified, the client will wait the value\n  returned by this function. No other value will be taken into account.\n- If the client specified TLS options, the client will generate a number between\n  0 and `reconnectJitterTLS` and add it to `reconnectTimeWait`.\n- If the client didn't specify TLS options, the client will generate a number\n  between 0 and `reconnectJitter` and add it to `reconnectTimeWait`.\n\n## JetStream\n\nJetStream is the NATS persistence engine providing streaming, message, and\nworker queues with At-Least-Once semantics.\n[Support for JetStream is built-in](https://github.com/nats-io/nats.deno/blob/main/jetstream.md).\n\n## Service API\n\nThe service API allows you to\n[easily build NATS services](https://github.com/nats-io/nats.deno/blob/main/services.md)\nThe services API is currently in beta functionality.\n\n## Contributing\n\nThe library shares client functionality with\n[NATS.deno](https://github.com/nats-io/nats.deno). This means that both the\nNATS.deno and NATS.js use the same exact code base, only differing on the\nimplementation of the `Transport`. This strategy greatly reduces the amount of\nwork required to develop and maintain the clients, as well as provide a\ncompletely compatible API across all clients.\n\nCurrently, the base client implementation is the deno implementation.

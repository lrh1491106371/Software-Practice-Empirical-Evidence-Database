It also adds improvements to\ndebug logging, along with some feature additions.\n\nAs a **breaking change**, by default a error handler is built into the MQTT.js client, so if any\nerrors are emitted and the user has not created an event handler on the client for errors, the client will\nnot break as a result of unhandled errors. Additionally, typical TLS errors like `ECONNREFUSED`, `ECONNRESET` have been\nadded to a list of TLS errors that will be emitted from the MQTT.js client, and so can be handled as connection errors.\n\n**v3.0.0** adds support for MQTT 5, support for node v10.x, and many fixes to improve reliability.\n\n**Note:** MQTT v5 support is experimental as it has not been implemented by brokers yet.\n\n**v2.0.0** removes support for node v0.8, v0.10 and v0.12, and it is 3x faster in sending\npackets. It also removes all the deprecated functionality in v1.0.0,\nmainly `mqtt.createConnection` and `mqtt.Server`. From v2.0.0,\nsubscriptions are restored upon reconnection if `clean: true`.\nv1.x.x is now in _LTS_, and it will keep being supported as long as\nthere are v0.8, v0.10 and v0.12 users.\n\nAs a **breaking change**, the `encoding` option in the old client is\nremoved, and now everything is UTF-8 with the exception of the\n`password` in the CONNECT message and `payload` in the PUBLISH message,\nwhich are `Buffer`.\n\nAnother **breaking change** is that MQTT.js now defaults to MQTT v3.1.1,\nso to support old brokers, please read the [client options doc](#client).\n\n**v1.0.0** improves the overall architecture of the project, which is now\nsplit into three components: MQTT.js keeps the Client,\n[mqtt-connection](http://npm.im/mqtt-connection) includes the barebone\nConnection code for server-side usage, and [mqtt-packet](http://npm.im/mqtt-packet)\nincludes the protocol parser and generator. The new Client improves\nperformance by a 30% factor, embeds Websocket support\n([MOWS](http://npm.im/mows) is now deprecated), and it has a better\nsupport for QoS 1 and 2. The previous API is still supported but\ndeprecated, as such, it is not documented in this README.\n\n<a name=\"install\"></a>\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\nnpm install mqtt --save\n```\n\n<a name=\"example\"></a>\n\n## Example\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, let's put the subscriber and the publisher in the same file:\n\n```js\nconst mqtt = require(\"mqtt\");\nconst client = mqtt.connect(\"mqtt://test.mosquitto.org\");\n\nclient.on(\"connect\", () => {\n  client.subscribe(\"presence\", (err) => {\n    if (!err) {\n      client.publish(\"presence\", \"Hello mqtt\");\n    }\n  });\n});\n\nclient.on(\"message\", (topic, message) => {\n  // message is Buffer\n  console.log(message.toString());\n  client.end();\n});\n```\n\noutput:\n\n```sh\nHello mqtt\n```\n\n<a name=\"example-react-native\"></a>\n\n### React Native\n\nMQTT.js can be used in React Native applications. To use it, see the [React Native example](https://github.com/MaximoLiberata/react-native-mqtt.js-example)\n\nIf you want to run your own MQTT broker, you can use\n[Mosquitto](http://mosquitto.org) or\n[Aedes-cli](https://github.com/moscajs/aedes-cli), and launch it.\n\nYou can also use a test instance: test.mosquitto.org.\n\nIf you do not want to install a separate broker, you can try using the\n[Aedes](https://github.com/moscajs/aedes).\n\n<a name=\"import_styles\"></a>\n\n## Import styles\n\n### CommonJS (Require)\n\n```js\nconst mqtt = require(\"mqtt\")  // require mqtt\nconst client = mqtt.connect(\"mqtt://test.mosquitto.org\")  // create a client\n```\n\n### ES6 Modules (Import)\n\n#### Default import\n\n```js\nimport mqtt from \"mqtt\"; // import namespace \"mqtt\"\nlet client = mqtt.connect(\"mqtt://test.mosquitto.org\"); // create a client\n```\n\n#### Importing individual components\n\n```js\nimport { connect } from \"mqtt\"; // import connect from mqtt\nlet client = connect(\"mqtt://test.mosquitto.org\"); // create a client\n```\n\n<a name=\"cli\"></a>\n\n## Command Line Tools\n\nMQTT.js bundles a command to interact with a broker.\nIn order to have it available on your path, you should install MQTT.js\nglobally:\n\n```sh\nnpm install mqtt -g\n```\n\nThen, on one terminal\n\n```sh\nmqtt sub -t 'hello' -h 'test.mosquitto.org' -v\n```\n\nOn another\n\n```sh\nmqtt pub -t 'hello' -h 'test.mosquitto.org' -m 'from MQTT.js'\n```\n\nSee `mqtt help <command>` for the command help.\n\n<a name=\"debug\"></a>\n\n## Debug Logs\n\nMQTT.js uses the [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug#cmd) package for debugging purposes. To enable debug logs, add the following environment variable on runtime :\n\n```ps\n# (example using PowerShell, the VS Code default)\n$env:DEBUG='mqttjs*'\n```\n\n<a name=\"reconnecting\"></a>\n\n## About Reconnection\n\nAn important part of any websocket connection is what to do when a connection\ndrops off and the client needs to reconnect. MQTT has built-in reconnection\nsupport that can be configured to behave in ways that suit the application.\n\n#### Refresh Authentication Options / Signed Urls with `transformWsUrl` (Websocket Only)\n\nWhen an mqtt connection drops and needs to reconnect, it's common to require\nthat any authentication associated with the connection is kept current with\nthe underlying auth mechanism. For instance some applications may pass an auth\ntoken with connection options on the initial connection, while other cloud\nservices may require a url be signed with each connection.\n\nBy the time the reconnect happens in the application lifecycle, the original\nauth data may have expired.\n\nTo address this we can use a hook called `transformWsUrl` to manipulate\neither of the connection url or the client options at the time of a reconnect.\n\nExample (update clientId & username on each reconnect):\n\n```js\n    const transformWsUrl = (url, options, client) => {\n      client.options.username = `token=${this.get_current_auth_token()}`;\n      client.options.clientId = `${this.get_updated_clientId()}`;\n\n      return `${this.get_signed_cloud_url(url)}`;\n    }\n\n    const connection = await mqtt.connectAsync(<wss url>, {\n      ...,\n      transformWsUrl: transformUrl,\n    });\n\n```\n\nNow every time a new WebSocket connection is opened (hopefully not too often),\nwe will get a fresh signed url or fresh auth token data.\n\nNote: Currently this hook does _not_ support promises, meaning that in order to\nuse the latest auth token, you must have some outside mechanism running that\nhandles application-level authentication refreshing so that the websocket\nconnection can simply grab the latest valid token or signed url.\n\n#### Customize Websockets with `createWebsocket` (Websocket Only)\n\nWhen you need to add a custom websocket subprotocol or header to open a connection\nthrough a proxy with custom authentication this callback allows you to create your own\ninstance of a websocket which will be used in the mqtt client.\n\n```js\n  const createWebsocket = (url, websocketSubProtocols, options) => {\n    const subProtocols = [\n      websocketSubProtocols[0],\n      'myCustomSubprotocolOrOAuthToken',\n    ]\n    return new WebSocket(url, subProtocols)\n  }\n\n  const client = await mqtt.connectAsync(<wss url>, {\n    ...,\n    createWebsocket: createWebsocket,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Enabling Reconnection with `reconnectPeriod` option\n\nTo ensure that the mqtt client automatically tries to reconnect when the\nconnection is dropped, you must set the client option `reconnectPeriod` to a\nvalue greater than 0. A value of 0 will disable reconnection and then terminate\nthe final connection when it drops.\n\nThe default value is 1000 ms which means it will try to reconnect 1 second\nafter losing the connection.\n\nNote that this will only enable reconnects after either a connection timeout, or\nafter a successful connection. It will _not_ (by default) enable retrying\nconnections that are actively denied with a CONNACK error by the server.\n\nTo also enable automatic reconnects for CONNACK errors, set\n`reconnectOnConnackError: true`.\n\n<a name=\"topicalias\"></a>\n\n## About Topic Alias Management\n\n### Enabling automatic Topic Alias using\n\nIf the client sets the option `autoUseTopicAlias:true` then MQTT.js uses existing topic alias automatically.\n\nexample scenario:\n\n```bash\n1. PUBLISH topic:'t1', ta:1                   (register)\n2. PUBLISH topic:'t1'       -> topic:'', ta:1 (auto use existing map entry)\n3. PUBLISH topic:'t2', ta:1                   (register overwrite)\n4. PUBLISH topic:'t2'       -> topic:'', ta:1 (auto use existing map entry based on the receent map)\n5. PUBLISH topic:'t1'                         (t1 is no longer mapped to ta:1)\n```\n\nUser doesn't need to manage which topic is mapped to which topic alias.\nIf the user want to register topic alias, then publish topic with topic alias.\nIf the user want to use topic alias, then publish topic without topic alias. If there is a mapped topic alias then added it as a property and update the topic to empty string.\n\n### Enabling automatic Topic Alias assign\n\nIf the client sets the option `autoAssignTopicAlias:true` then MQTT.js uses existing topic alias automatically.\nIf no topic alias exists, then assign a new vacant topic alias automatically. If topic alias is fully used, then LRU(Least Recently Used) topic-alias entry is overwritten.\n\nexample scenario:\n\n```bash\nThe broker returns CONNACK (TopicAliasMaximum:3)\n1. PUBLISH topic:'t1' -> 't1', ta:1 (auto assign t1:1 and register)\n2. PUBLISH topic:'t1' -> ''  , ta:1 (auto use existing map entry)\n3. PUBLISH topic:'t2' -> 't2', ta:2 (auto assign t1:2 and register. 2 was vacant)\n4. PUBLISH topic:'t3' -> 't3', ta:3 (auto assign t1:3 and register. 3 was vacant)\n5. PUBLISH topic:'t4' -> 't4', ta:1 (LRU entry is overwritten)\n```\n\nAlso user can manually register topic-alias pair using PUBLISH topic:'some', ta:X. It works well with automatic topic alias assign.\n\n<a name=\"api\"></a>\n\n## API\n\n- [`mqtt.connect()`](#connect)\n- [`mqtt.connectAsync()`](#connect-async)\n- [`mqtt.Client()`](#client)\n- [`mqtt.Client#connect()`](#client-connect)\n- [`mqtt.Client#publish()`](#publish)\n- [`mqtt.Client#publishAsync()`](#publish-async)\n- [`mqtt.Client#subscribe()`](#subscribe)\n- [`mqtt.Client#subscribeAsync()`](#subscribe-async)\n- [`mqtt.Client#unsubscribe()`](#unsubscribe)\n- [`mqtt.Client#unsubscribeAsync()`](#unsubscribe-async)\n- [`mqtt.Client#end()`](#end)\n- [`mqtt.Client#endAsync()`](#end-async)\n- [`mqtt.Client#removeOutgoingMessage()`](#removeOutgoingMessage)\n- [`mqtt.Client#reconnect()`](#reconnect)\n- [`mqtt.Client#handleMessage()`](#handleMessage)\n- [`mqtt.Client#connected`](#connected)\n- [`mqtt.Client#reconnecting`](#reconnecting)\n- [`mqtt.Client#getLastMessageId()`](#getLastMessageId)\n- [`mqtt.Store()`](#store)\n- [`mqtt.Store#put()`](#put)\n- [`mqtt.Store#del()`](#del)\n- [`mqtt.Store#createStream()`](#createStream)\n- [`mqtt.Store#close()`](#close)\n\n---\n\n<a name=\"connect\"></a>\n\n### mqtt.connect([url], options)\n\nConnects to the broker specified by the given url and options and\nreturns a [Client](#client).\n\nThe URL can be on the following protocols: 'mqtt', 'mqtts', 'tcp',\n'tls', 'ws', 'wss', 'wxs', 'alis'. If you are trying to connect to a unix socket just append the `+unix` suffix to the protocol (ex: `mqtt+unix`). This will set the `unixSocket` property automatically.\n\nThe URL can also be an object as returned by\n[`URL.parse()`](http://nodejs.org/api/url.html#url_url_parse_urlstr_parsequerystring_slashesdenotehost),\nin that case the two objects are merged, i.e. you can pass a single\nobject with both the URL and the connect options.\n\nYou can also specify a `servers` options with content: `[{ host:\n'localhost', port: 1883 }, ... ]`, in that case that array is iterated\nat every connect.\n\nFor all MQTT-related options, see the [Client](#client)\nconstructor.\n\n<a name=\"connect-async\"></a>\n\n### connectAsync([url], options)\n\nAsynchronous wrapper around the [`connect`](#connect) function.\n\nReturns a `Promise` that resolves to a `mqtt.Client` instance when the client\nfires a `'connect'` or `'end'` event, or rejects with an error if the `'error'`\nis fired.\n\nNote that the `manualConnect` option will cause the promise returned by this\nfunction to never resolve or reject as the underlying client never fires any\nevents.\n\n---\n\n<a name=\"client\"></a>\n\n### mqtt.Client(streamBuilder, options)\n\nThe `Client` class wraps a client connection to an\nMQTT broker over an arbitrary transport method (TCP, TLS,\nWebSocket, ecc).\n`Client` is an [EventEmitter](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/asynchronous-work/the-nodejs-event-emitter) that has it's own [events](#events)\n\n`Client` automatically handles the following:\n\n- Regular server pings\n- QoS flow\n- Automatic reconnections\n- Start publishing before being connected\n\nThe arguments are:\n\n- `streamBuilder` is a function that returns a subclass of the `Stream` class that supports\n  the `connect` event. Typically a `net.Socket`.\n- `options` is the client connection options (see: the [connect packet](https://github.com/mcollina/mqtt-packet#connect)). Defaults:\n  - `wsOptions`: is the WebSocket connection options. Default is `{}`.\n    It's specific for WebSockets. For possible options have a look at: <https://github.com/websockets/ws/blob/master/doc/ws.md>.\n  - `keepalive`: `60` seconds, set to `0` to disable\n  - `reschedulePings`: reschedule ping messages after sending packets (default `true`)\n  - `clientId`: `'mqttjs_' + Math.random().toString(16).substr(2, 8)`\n  - `protocolId`: `'MQTT'`\n  - `protocolVersion`: `4`\n  - `clean`: `true`, set to false to receive QoS 1 and 2 messages while\n    offline\n  - `reconnectPeriod`: `1000` milliseconds, interval between two\n    reconnections. Disable auto reconnect by setting to `0`.\n  - `reconnectOnConnackError`: `false`, whether to also reconnect if a CONNACK\n    is received with an error.\n  - `connectTimeout`: `30 * 1000` milliseconds, time to wait before a\n    CONNACK is received\n  - `username`: the username required by your broker, if any\n  - `password`: the password required by your broker, if any\n  - `socksProxy`: establish TCP and TLS connections via a socks proxy (URL, supported protocols are `socks5://`, `socks5h://`, `socks4://`, `socks4a://`)\n  - `socksTimeout`: timeout for connecting to the socks proxy\n  - `incomingStore`: a [Store](#store) for the incoming packets\n  - `outgoingStore`: a [Store](#store) for the outgoing packets\n  - `queueQoSZero`: if connection is broken, queue outgoing QoS zero messages (default `true`)\n  - `customHandleAcks`: MQTT 5 feature of custom handling puback and pubrec packets. Its callback:\n\n    ```js\n      customHandleAcks: function(topic, message, packet, done) {/*some logic with calling done(error, reasonCode)*/}\n    ```\n\n  - `autoUseTopicAlias`: enabling automatic Topic Alias using functionality\n  - `autoAssignTopicAlias`: enabling automatic Topic Alias assign functionality\n  - `properties`: properties MQTT 5.0.\n    `object` that supports the following properties:\n    - `sessionExpiryInterval`: representing the Session Expiry Interval in seconds `number`,\n    - `receiveMaximum`: representing the Receive Maximum value `number`,\n    - `maximumPacketSize`: representing the Maximum Packet Size the Client is willing to accept `number`,\n    - `topicAliasMaximum`: representing the Topic Alias Maximum value indicates the highest value that the Client will accept as a Topic Alias sent by the Server `number`,\n    - `requestResponseInformation`: The Client uses this value to request the Server to return Response Information in the CONNACK `boolean`,\n    - `requestProblemInformation`: The Client uses this value to indicate whether the Reason String or User Properties are sent in the case of failures `boolean`,\n    - `userProperties`: The User Property is allowed to appear multiple times to represent multiple name, value pairs `object`,\n    - `authenticationMethod`: the name of the authentication method used for extended authentication `string`,\n    - `authenticationData`: Binary Data containing authentication data `binary`\n  - `authPacket`: settings for auth packet `object`\n  - `will`: a message that will sent by the broker automatically when\n    the client disconnect badly. The format is:\n    - `topic`: the topic to publish\n    - `payload`: the message to publish\n    - `qos`: the QoS\n    - `retain`: the retain flag\n    - `properties`: properties of will by MQTT 5.0:\n      - `willDelayInterval`: representing the Will Delay Interval in seconds `number`,\n      - `payloadFormatIndicator`: Will Message is UTF-8 Encoded Character Data or not `boolean`,\n      - `messageExpiryInterval`: value is the lifetime of the Will Message in seconds and is sent as the Publication Expiry Interval when the Server publishes the Will Message `number`,\n      - `contentType`: describing the content of the Will Message `string`,\n      - `responseTopic`: String which is used as the Topic Name for a response message `string`,\n      - `correlationData`: The Correlation Data is used by the sender of the Request Message to identify which request the Response Message is for when it is received `binary`,\n      - `userProperties`: The User Property is allowed to appear multiple times to represent multiple name, value pairs `object`\n  - `transformWsUrl` : optional `(url, options, client) => url` function\n    For ws/wss protocols only. Can be used to implement signing\n    urls which upon reconnect can have become expired.\n  - `createWebsocket` : optional `url, websocketSubProtocols, options) => Websocket` function\n      For ws/wss protocols only. Can be used to implement a custom websocket subprotocol or implementation.\n  - `resubscribe` : if connection is broken and reconnects,\n    subscribed topics are automatically subscribed again (default `true`)\n  - `subscribeBatchSize` : optional `number`\n    Maximum number of topics per SUBSCRIBE packet. When the number of topics to subscribe exceeds this value, the client will automatically split them into multiple SUBSCRIBE packets of this size.\n  - `messageIdProvider`: custom messageId provider. when `new UniqueMessageIdProvider()` is set, then non conflict messageId is provided.\n  - `log`: custom log function. Default uses [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) package.\n  - `manualConnect`: prevents the constructor to call `connect`. In this case after the `mqtt.connect` is called you should call `client.connect` manually.\n  - `timerVariant`: defaults to `auto`, which tries to determine which timer is most appropriate for you environment, if you're having detection issues, you can set it to `worker` or `native`. If none suits you, you can pass a timer object with set and clear properties:\n    ```js\n    timerVariant: {\n      set: (func, timer) => setInterval(func, timer),\n      clear: (id) => clearInterval(id)\n    }\n    ```\n  - `forceNativeWebSocket`: set to true if you're having detection issues (i.e. the `ws does not work in the browser` exception) to force the use of native WebSocket. It is important to note that if set to true for the first client created, then all the clients will use native WebSocket. And conversely, if not set or set to false, all will use the detection result.\n  - `unixSocket`: if you want to connect to a unix socket, set this to true\n\nInstead of setting `socksProxy` you can also supple the same parameter via the environment variable `MQTTJS_SOCKS_PROXY`.\n\nIn case mqtts (mqtt over tls) is required, the `options` object is passed through to [`tls.connect()`](http://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_options_callback). If using a **self-signed certificate**, set `rejectUnauthorized: false`. However, be cautious as this exposes you to potential man in the middle attacks and isn't recommended for production.\n\nFor those supporting multiple TLS protocols on a single port, like MQTTS and MQTT over WSS, utilize the `ALPNProtocols` option. This lets you define the Application Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) protocol. You can set `ALPNProtocols` as a string array, Buffer, or Uint8Array based on your setup.\n\nIf you are connecting to a broker that supports only MQTT 3.1 (not\n3.1.1 compliant), you should pass these additional options:\n\n```js\n{\n  protocolId: 'MQIsdp',\n  protocolVersion: 3\n}\n```\n\nThis is confirmed on RabbitMQ 3.2.4, and on Mosquitto < 1.3. Mosquitto\nversion 1.3 and 1.4 works fine without those.\n\n<a name=\"events\"></a>\n\n#### Event `'connect'`\n\n`function (connack) {}`\n\nEmitted on successful (re)connection (i.e. connack rc=0).\n\n- `connack` received connack packet. When `clean` connection option is `false` and server has a previous session\n  for `clientId` connection option, then `connack.sessionPresent` flag is `true`. When that is the case,\n  you may rely on stored session and prefer not to send subscribe commands for the client.\n\n#### Event `'reconnect'`\n\n`function () {}`\n\nEmitted when a reconnect starts.\n\n#### Event `'close'`\n\n`function () {}`\n\nEmitted after a disconnection.\n\n#### Event `'disconnect'`\n\n`function (packet) {}`\n\nEmitted after receiving disconnect packet from broker.

This is totally transparent to users except for the following:\n\n- The `wsOption` is not supported in browsers.\n- Browsers doesn't allow to catch many WebSocket errors for [security reasons](https://stackoverflow.com/a/31003057) as:\n\n  > Access to this information could allow a malicious Web page to gain information about your network, so they require browsers report all connection-time errors in an indistinguishable way.\n\n  So listening for `client.on('error')` may not catch all the errors you would get in NodeJS env.\n\n### Bundle\n\nMQTT.js is bundled using [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/). It is tested working with all bundlers like Webpack, Vite and React.\n\nYou can find all mqtt bundles versions in `dist` folder:\n\n- `mqtt.js` - iife format, not minified\n- `mqtt.min.js` - iife format, minified\n- `mqtt.esm.js` - esm format minified\n\nStarting from MQTT.js > 5.2.0 you can import mqtt in your code like this:\n\n```js\nimport mqtt from 'mqtt'\n```\n\nThis will be automatically handled by your bundler.\n\nOtherwise you can choose to use a specific bundle like:\n\n```js\nimport * as mqtt from 'mqtt/dist/mqtt'\nimport * as mqtt from 'mqtt/dist/mqtt.min'\nimport mqtt from 'mqtt/dist/mqtt.esm'\n```\n\n<a name=\"cdn\"></a>\n\n### Via CDN\n\nThe MQTT.js bundle is available through <http://unpkg.com>, specifically\nat <https://unpkg.com/mqtt/dist/mqtt.min.js>.\nSee <http://unpkg.com> for the full documentation on version ranges.\n\n<a name=\"qos\"></a>\n\n## About QoS\n\nHere is how QoS works:\n\n- QoS 0 : received **at most once** : The packet is sent, and that's it. There is no validation about whether it has been received.\n- QoS 1 : received **at least once** : The packet is sent and stored as long as the client has not received a confirmation from the server. MQTT ensures that it _will_ be received, but there can be duplicates.\n- QoS 2 : received **exactly once** : Same as QoS 1 but there is no duplicates.\n\nAbout data consumption, obviously, QoS 2 > QoS 1 > QoS 0, if that's a concern to you.\n\n<a name=\"typescript\"></a>\n\n## Usage with TypeScript\n\nStarting from v5 this project is written in TypeScript and the type definitions are included in the package.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { connect } from \"mqtt\"\nconst client = connect('mqtt://test.mosquitto.org')\n```\n\n<a name=\"weapp-alipay\"></a>\n\n## WeChat and Ali Mini Program support\n\n### WeChat Mini Program\n\nSupports [WeChat Mini Program](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/).
